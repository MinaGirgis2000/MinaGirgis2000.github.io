## Experience
### Computer Science
- I am a self-taught programmer with experience in Java, Python, HTML, CSS (basics), and JavaScript
- I have been using Linux for the past year with experience with the command line and cybersecurity.
    - I have used multiple Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and am currently using Manjaro which is based on Arch Linux.
- I have been working on multiple programming projects which include both large and small ones within my free time.
- I have even implemented some automatons into my everyday life and they have helped me dramatically with getting things done in a much more easier and efficient way.
- I have also been working on building a website that involves my dad's business, but it is still a work in progress.
- I am also currently working through Harvard’s CS50 and SANS Foundation’s cybersecurity (SEC275) online courses.

### Boy Scouts of America
- I am currently a Life Scout, the sixth of the seven ranks in Scouting, as a registered Boy Scout of America member in Troop 111.

    - Patrol Leader for a (1) year term: in charge of a whole patrol during scout meetings, campouts, activities, etc.
    - Senior Patrol Leader for a (1) year term: representing the entire troop during meetings and ceremonies. I also planned with the Scoutmasters of the troop for yearly agendas, activities and campouts.
    - Currently playing the role of Troop Guide: I am responsible for teaching and guiding the junior scout members through scouting skills and requirements to get into the scout environment.
- I have also attended and taught a course for Introduction to Leadership Skills in Troops (ILST) which taught me how to make clever decisions as a leader in my troop.
- I am also on my way into achieving my Eagle Scout rank, which is the highest rank in the Scouting program, through the completion of the Eagle Project. The project requires many arrangements and requires my leadership over a large group of volunteers to implement it my project in a chosen community.
    - My project consisted of creating a comfortable non-hazardous surface with turf over the top with a playground for the youth of my church to enjoy.

### Other
- Harvard’s CS50 Course
- Cyberstart America
- SANS Foundation (SEC275)
- Kahn Academy & Crash Course
    - Computer Science
    - Physics

## Other
### Volunteer Service
- As a Scout member, the volunteer service is considered as one of many major requirements throughout the journey. I volunteered in many community services through the county, city, and the church.
- Many of the services include cleaning the church, cooking for the needy, beach sweeping, weeding, etc.

### Other Experience
- Hour of Code Project: As a part of Code club, last school year, I have participated in the Hour of Code program where we group up and come up with ideas to give little introductions to children of the world of programming and one of its many capabilities. This has given me the experience to work well within a group of people and has also advanced my planning skills.
- I have a suitable amount of experience with using tools to fix electronic equipment due to my experience with assisting my dad for the past couple of years with mechanical and electrical work. I have been growing and learning a lot from his experience with tech throughout my "apprenticeship" with him.
- I am very handy when it comes to troubleshooting computers and other devices. I am well capable of finding out solutions to fix problems on my own without assistance.
