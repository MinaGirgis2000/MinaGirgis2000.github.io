### What is an Eagle Project?
The Boy Scouts of America Eagle Project is a project required for the completion of the last rank in the program known as the Eagle rank. This is the last and final rank and the hardest rank to acheive in Boy Scouts. Only a small portion of all Boy Scouts managed to complete the rank through their Scouting journey. The purpose of it is to show your leadership and planning skills when managing a huge project.

### What was my Eagle Project and where was it executed?
My Eagle Project consisted of a kids playground with completed turf surfacing and layers of cushioning. I hired a contractor to dig a 6 inch hole into the ground and insert 2 inches of stone dust and 4 inches of gravel. With the help of my fellow scouts and scout parents, we put on the turf surfacing and used a broom and infill to make the fake grass stand up and look better. We then built the whole playground and ended up adding in solar lights at the end to allow for people see at night. We also added a border of wood to help with the separation between real grass and the turf. It was all executed at St. Mina's Coptic Orthodox Church in Holmdel, New Jersey.

### How did I pay for the project to commence?
I raised up money for the project using both a GoFundMe page and creating a table for donations at my church for donating with cash and/or checks. I had a goal of $4000 and raised $4100. However, I did use more money than I made at the end due to the surface of the playground.

### How much planning it take for me to finish the project?
It took about six months of planning and research and about one month for the execution.

### What were some of challenges that I faced through my completion of this project?
One of my many challenges was the weather during the execution of the project. It started raining for a full week in the middle, so I did little to no building during that week which set me behind schedule. Another challenge was that the contractor that I hired did not do the full job correct as I needed him to and he caused me to use more money that I was supposed to use. I also had a lot of trouble with finding material layering that is within the budget and can complete the job. I had to change from the original material that I planned on using due to the increasing amounts of expenses.
