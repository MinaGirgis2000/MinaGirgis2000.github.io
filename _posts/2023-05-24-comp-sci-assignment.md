### 1. Getting into programming as a freshman
Last year, during my 9th-grade year, I ventured into the world of programming, and it turned out to be a transformative experience. It not only ignited a passion within me but also provided clarity about my future career aspirations. Exploring the intricacies of coding allowed me to discover my true calling. Moreover, delving into this field presented me with the opportunity to forge connections with like-minded individuals who shared my enthusiasm for programming. Together, we embarked on a journey of knowledge and growth. Programming also served as a constant challenge, pushing the boundaries of my critical thinking skills and forcing me to approach problems with creativity and logic. This newfound endeavor has undoubtedly shaped my perspective and opened doors to a world of possibilities.

### 2. Becomming more social and being more of a leader
Embarking on a journey of personal growth, I experienced a significant transformation in my social skills. The catalyst for this change came when I immersed myself in the world of Boy Scouts. Through my involvement in the troop, I not only learned valuable leadership skills but also discovered how to effectively communicate and connect with others. As a former introvert, social interactions used to fill me with unease and shyness. However, through the challenges and responsibilities within the Scouts, I gradually developed the ability to confidently engage in conversations and speak publicly. This newfound confidence has empowered me to step out of my comfort zone and embrace social opportunities with enthusiasm. It's truly remarkable how a supportive environment and the pursuit of personal development can shape one's social aptitude and ultimately foster a more vibrant and fulfilling life.

### 3. I am capable of rapidly improving any flaws within me
One of my greatest strengths lies in my ability to swiftly address and improve upon my shortcomings when necessary. Whether it's excelling in academics, assuming leadership roles, or eliminating detrimental habits, I have developed a proactive approach to personal growth. In the realm of education, I embrace challenges head-on and work diligently to enhance my performance. By leveraging my determination and resilience, I have been able to make significant strides in my academic pursuits. Additionally, I have actively sought opportunities to become a leader, seizing chances to guide and inspire others towards success. Recognizing the importance of self-improvement, I have also taken decisive steps to break free from negative habits, fostering a healthier and more productive lifestyle. This relentless pursuit of growth has allowed me to continually evolve, adapt, and emerge as a more refined and capable individual.
