## Experience:
#### Boy Scouts of America:
- I am currently a Life Scout, the sixth of the seven ranks in Scouting, as a registered Boy Scout of America member in Troop 111.
- I was elected to be the Patrol Leader for a (1) year term, in charge of a whole patrol during scout meetings, campouts, and activities.
- I have also been elected to be a Senior Patrol Leader for a (1) year term, representing the troop during meetings and ceremonies and I have been planning with the Scoutmasters to for yearly agendas, activities and campouts.
- In addition, I am currently playing the role of Troop Guide in the troop in which I am responsible for teaching and guiding the junior scout members through scouting skills and requirements to get into the scout environment.
- I have also attented and taught a course for Introduction to Leadership Skills in Troops (ILST) which taught me how to make clever decisions as a leader in my troop.
- I am also on my way into achieving my Eagle Scout rank, which is the highest rank in the Scouting program, through the completion of the Eagle Project. The project requires many arrangements and requires my leadership over a large group of volunteers to implement it my project in a chosen community.

#### Volunteer Service:
- As a Scout member, the volunteer service is considered as one of many major requirements throughout the journey. I volunteered in many community services through the county, city, and the church.
- Many of the services include cleaning the church, cooking for the needy, beach sweeping, weeding, etc.

#### School:
- I am a registered member in many clubs in school, such as Code Club and German Honor Society.
- These clubs have given me a lot of social experience and helped me advance my knowledge in miscellaneous things that may benefit me throughout my life such as participating in multiple programming competitions and advance my knowledge in a foreign language and be able to join other activities that give a lot of social experience.

#### Other:
- Hour of Code Project: As a part of Code club, this year, I have participated in the Hour of Code program where we group up and come up with ideas to give little introductions to children of the world of programming and its one of its many capabilities. This has given me the experience to work well within a group of people and has also advanced my planning skills.

## Technical Experience:
#### Programming:
- I have experience working with the following languages which I self-taught myself:
    - Java (most experience)
    - Python
    - HTML
    - CSS (basics)
    - JavaScript
- I have been working on multiple programming projects which include both large and small ones within my free time.
- I have also even implemented some automations into my everyday life and they have both helped me dramatically with getting things done in a much more easier and efficient way.
- I have also been working on a website recently that involves my dad's business, but it's still a work in progress.

#### GNU/Linux:
- I have been using Linux for the past couple of months and it's been a great experience when it comes to learning the command line and getting used to a new environment.
- I have experience in using Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and I am currently using Manjaro which is based on Arch Linux.

#### Other:
- I have a suitable amount of experience with using tools to fix electronic equipment when helping my dad for the past couple of years and have been growing and learning a lot from his experience with tech throughout my "apprenticeship" with him.
- I am very handy when it comes to troubleshooting computers or other devices. I am well capable of finding out solutions to fix problems on my own without anyone's help.

## Other Experience:
I believe that from the skills I gained over time, I am well capable of going through new, harder challenges that come from this job. I am well focused and put my best effort in completing any task assigned to me. I also believe that I am capable of quickly grasping new concepts in a short period of time. I look forward to gaining experience from this job, not only in advancing my programming/web development skills, but also increase my problem solving and teamworking skills.
