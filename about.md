## Hey, I'm MinaðŸ‘‹

I am a sophomore attending East Brunswick High School, where I am passionate about exploring the fascinating world of technology and artificial intelligence. From a young age, I've been captivated by the possibilities that these fields offer, and I'm constantly seeking ways to expand my knowledge and skills.

As a self-taught programmer, I have delved into several programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through countless hours of dedication and hands-on practice, I've developed a strong foundation in these languages, allowing me to bring ideas to life through coding.

Beyond the world of technology, I have been an active member of the Boy Scouts of America for four years, proudly belonging to Troop 111. Within this esteemed organization, I have attained the rank of Life Scout, which is the sixth out of the seven ranks in scouting. Throughout my scouting journey, I have held various leadership positions, including Patrol Leader, Senior Patrol Leader, and Troop Guide. These roles have not only sharpened my organizational and teamworking skills but have also allowed me to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of my fellow scouts.
